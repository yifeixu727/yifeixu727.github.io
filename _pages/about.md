# 🤠 About Me
I am a second year graduate student from [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn). I recieved my B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, in Summer 2023. I am currently working toward the M.S. degree in Electronic Science and Technology with the School of Information Science and Technology ([SIST](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn)), ShanghaiTech University, Shanghai, China. My research interests include:
- **AI for Energy (AI4E)**, especially for batteries
- **State of health (SOH) estimation**
- **Remaining useful life (RUL) prediction**
- Fault detection 
- Time series forcasting

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
